        <h1>I LOVE YOU BABY</h1>
        <p class="love-letter">
            Hey, baby. I am writing to express my feelings, gratitude, and our future plans together. Let's just start with the first time I met you. You were like a super cool person that I wanted to talk to, but after seeing your age, I changed my mind. However, fate wanted us to meet again. After some months, you started talking in the Keshi server. I didn't notice you at first and forgot about you, but after some days, you joined the Fruit Loop server. You were kind of wild and cute at the same time.

I keep saying that I was not interested in you, but in a non-romantic way. I wanted to focus on my career and felt hesitant because of our age and other things. So, after some days, we started talking in DMs and stalking Keshi. I wasn't that interested, but you still wanted to talk to me. After you sent me some John Mayer songs, I thought you were pretty cute and wanted to talk to you.

After talking and talking, I started caring for you like my love. I wanted to be there for you all the time, especially when your dad was not at home and you were home alone. I was so worried about you that I started thinking about us. However, I was still paranoid due to our age and other reasons. After some days, you started texting me in Vietnamese and deleting it. I thought it was suspicious and actually translated some words. You said, "anh la nguoi de thuong nhat the gioi," but I thought you said it as a friend.

You were giving me a lot of hints, but I was too dumb to catch on. After some time, I mustered up the courage and said "I love you" in Japanese, but I decided to delete it. However, you were so fast and caught me. I was super nervous, thinking that our relationship was going to end, but you accepted my love. I was so happy that day. At the same time, I was scared that people would find out about us, and I cared about others more than you. I stopped you from doing a lot of things, and it was my biggest mistake.

When Elmo found out about us, I did so many stupid things. I got emotional and blamed you, even though you were right all the time. You fought for our relationship, and you saved it. You were fighting all the time. Babe, you saved our relationship. I didn't want to let you go; I wanted you so bad. All I want to say right now is, "I am sorry, baby. I was wrong all the time. I know you forgave me, but I still want to say sorry because I was hurting you so bad that I didn't even realize. All I want to say is I need you in my life. I don't know if I can live without you."

After some time, I realized that all I care about is you and no one else. I blocked everyone and wanted you to trust me. I wanted you to realize that I care about you and only you. I was ready to give up on so many people, and it was the best choice of my life. And now, we are here. I know we had some ups and downs when you told me about your past and that guy you talked with, but it's okiee now. You love me, and only me. I was super sad, but I know I have to go with it and love you more. I know you had a rough past, and I want to make our future happy.

We talk all day; we do it all day. I love it when you do it with me. I feel special, babe. All I want is you, and I want my future to be with you. I am willing to work super hard to provide for you and give you all my love. I know we have so many years, but just remember, babe, my feelings for you are never going to change. Just stay with me for some years, babe, and I will give you our future. Baby, I love you so much. Please just stay with me. I want you; I need you, babe. All I want is for you to stay with me and only me.

I know you said you are willing to stay with me, but I worry about it all day. What if you find someone who is willing to provide for you, buy you sushi, and give you a lot? It kinda scares me, and my chest hurts. I feel this sinking feeling where my heart is. It's kinda broken sometimes, but I know you love me and are willing to stay with me, so I just cope.

Hey yeah, babe, I know you sometimes get anxious or worried about your body being fat and your chest being small, but you just assume things. You know, babe, we always compare ourselves with others and feel bad. You are super slim, and your chest is not small; it's beautiful and delightful. I am not saying this because I love you; it's the truth, and you need to accept it. Don't worry about your body, babe. I am blessed to have you and your body for mine. God gifted me you, and I have to treasure it and work for it.

Baby, please never worry about your body and anything. Your chest is big, your ass is fine, and you are not fat. You are super duper slim, okiee?
UHM UHMMM 

Babe, I love you so much that if I tried to really write how much I love you, I would be writing for the rest of my life. You bring out so much. You fight for our relationship. It's like when we are together, the rest of the world disappears, and nothing else matters but us. I hope I feel this way forever. I want to spend the rest of my life loving you with everything. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve someone as loving as you are. Do you know how long I waited to have someone like you in my life? It wasn't luck that brought us together. You are a blessing to me, and I wouldn't trade the way I feel about you for anything in this world. You are the reason why I smile. You are the first thing on my mind when I wake up every morning, and you are the last thing I think about every night before I say "OYAA SOMEE MEE NAA SAII" and close my eyes. But our time together doesn't end there because you are the only thing I dream about. I want to spend the rest of my life with you if you allow me to. Nothing is too much to give you. I feel that if you're not happy, I feel so sad whenever you worry about your body. I always try to find a way to make you feel reassured that there is nothing wrong with you. Baby, I love you so much.

Babe, I just want to thank you for loving me so much, and I am yours forever. You know, it is strange how I had to go through so many bad situations before you came into my life. I was not going to date anyone in my life until I was stable because I didn't want to hurt someone with someone unstable like me. I really wanted some love, and you are the one who gave me that even though I was not perfect. I was nothing, but you stayed with someone like me. Babe, you really are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I just want you to know that I love you so much, MY SWEETHEART, and I want to be with you till we die together. I know we have to work hard together for some years. I really want to see you as my little rockstar making songs about our love. I want to be with you all the time, sitting behind in the backstage, seeing you perform, taking you home from your concert, changing your clothes, bathing your tired self, and making your favorite food, sleeping together. I want you to achieve this, and I am willing to give you everything even if you fail (I know you won't). I will stay with you forever. I will provide for you. I will work hard with you. So, know that I am always longing for you and your presence. Know that you will always be everything to me, even though I have not yet met you. I JUST WANNA BE WITH YOU ALL THE TIME I KNOW I AM NOT PERFECT I AM NOT HANDSOME BUT BABE I AM GONNA GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT BABY I WANNA MARRY YOU PLEASE STAY WITH ME FOREVER AND EVER 
In the end i was writing you this soo you will never worry about our relationship and your body and other things i want you and i really LOVE YOU MY WIFEY I WILL STAY WITH YOU FOREVER DONT WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE PIMPLES AND OTHER THINGS OKIEEEEALJDKLAFJDKLAJ.
